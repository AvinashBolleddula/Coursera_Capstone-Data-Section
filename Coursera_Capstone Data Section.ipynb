My predictor or target variable will be 'SEVERITYCODE' because it is used to measure the severity of an accident. \n1.'SEVERITYCODE' Attribute has class 1 and class 2 within the dataset, where class 1 means property damage and class 2 means injury. \n1. Attributes used to weigh the severity of an accident are 'WEATHER', 'ROADCOND' and 'LIGHTCOND'.\n1. As the above attributes are object type, I will use label encoding to convert them to numeric types so that the data will easy for modeling        and predicting purposes.\n1. As data was unbalanced , I will use downssampling to balance the data.\n1. I will normalize the data to zero mean and unit variance for better accuracy.\n1. At the same time I will replace Missing values in the dataset with their respective modes for the object type attributes."
