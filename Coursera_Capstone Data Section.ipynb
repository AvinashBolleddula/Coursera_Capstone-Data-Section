This dataset has 37 attributes,194673 observations, out of these 37 attributes I will be using 3 attributes namely                    WEATHER,ROADCOND,LIGHTCOND for development of my model to predict 'SEVERITYCODE' Attribute.\n1. WEATHER,ROADCOND,LIGHTCOND Attributes are object type and SEVERITYCODE is numeric type data.\n1. There are 15,263 missing values combined in the WEATHER,ROADCOND,LIGHTCOND Attributes.\n1. SEVERITYCODE Attribute is unbalanced with 136485 observations are of class 1 and 58188 observations are of class 2. \n1. My predictor or target variable will be 'SEVERITYCODE' because it is used to measure the severity of an accident. \n1. 'SEVERITYCODE' Attribute has class 1 and class 2 within the dataset, where class 1 means property damage and class 2 means injury. \n1. Attributes used to weigh the severity of an accident are 'WEATHER', 'ROADCOND' and 'LIGHTCOND'. These attributes give information    about weather,road and light conditions.\n1. As the above attributes are object type, I will use label encoding to convert them to numeric types so that the data will easy for    modeling and predicting purposes.\n1. As data was unbalanced , I will use downssampling to balance the data.\n1. I will normalize the data to zero mean and unit variance for better accuracy.\n1. At the same time I will replace Missing values in the dataset with their respective modes for the object type attributes."
